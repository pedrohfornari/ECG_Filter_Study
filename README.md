# ECG_Filter_Study
A MatLab project to study some approaches to design and implement ECG filters

This project was implemented by Pedro Fornari and Gustavo Leao to study some approaches on ECG filters design
We developped algorithms to promediate the signal, calculate some periods of medical interest like RR and QT
We also applied low pass filters, high pass filters approaching the problem in annother way
Finally we also made a moving average filter which is more implemented in real time applications because of its great time response.

For more details please read the pdf document, which is only in portuguese by now.
